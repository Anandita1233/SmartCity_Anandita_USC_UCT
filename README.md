Project 9: Forecasting of Smart city traffic patterns 
We are working with the government to transform various cities into a smart city. The vision is to convert it into a digital and intelligent city to
improve the efficiency of services for the citizens. One of the problems faced by the government is traffic. You are a data scientist working to manage
the traffic of the city better and to provide input on infrastructure planning for the future. 
The government wants to implement a robust traffic system for the city by being prepared for traffic peaks. They want to understand the traffic patterns 
of the four junctions of the city. Traffic patterns on holidays, as well as on various other occasions during the year, differ from normal working days. 
This is important to take into account for your forecasting.

For municipal administrators and transport planners, predicting traffic has never been easy. The demand for precise and dependable traffic predictions has increased
as cities and the number of cars on the roadways continue to expand. Machine learning has made significant progress in resolving this issue in recent years.

Predicting how traffic will behave in the future in a certain location is known as traffic prediction. The optimisation of transport networks, 
lowering traffic congestion, and raising road safety are only a few of the uses for this information. In the past, time-series analysis and rule-based 
models have been used as thefoundation for traffic prediction. However, the complexity and variety of traffic patterns are frequently beyond the scope of these techniques.

Contrarily, machine learning is ideally adapted to managing big, complicated information, which makes it a perfect tool for traffic forecasting. Machine learning algorithms can utilise the patterns and correlations they discover in traffic data to anticipate how traffic will behave in the future.

Regression, time-series analysis, and artificial neural networks are a few examples of machine learning methods that may be utilised for traffic prediction.
Regression models use past traffic patterns to forecast current traffic conditions. Time-series analysis models analyse traffic data trends over time and utilise 
these patterns to generate forecasts. In order to anticipate traffic, artificial neural networks—which are based on the structure of the human brain—are frequently 
employed.
